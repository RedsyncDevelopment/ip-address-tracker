# IP Address Tracker

Try it here: [IP Address Tracker](https://ip-address-tracker-redsync.netlify.app)

This project was created as a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) - [IP Address Tracker](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).

## How to use?

It's easy: just type an IP Address or Domain of some site and you get more information about it!

## How it works?

I've used [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) to fetch information about certain IP address and then display it on a map provided by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)

## Used technologies:

For this project I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) w/ [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It was an overkill to use React but I wanted to practice. There is a state folder for managing global state but it's empty (That's just my standard template for React Apps)

### React

I've created this project using [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)

### Tailwind

Setting up Tailwind for React projects can be found at [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

### TypeScript

I use TypeScript for all my React project and you can find more about that in official create-react-app [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
